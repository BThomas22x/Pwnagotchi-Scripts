# Pwnagotchi-Scripts
Scripts to run in pwnagotchi to make life a little easier.  I recommend creating a scripts folder to keep them in.  

<b>1.</b> <i>hsremove.sh</i> -- A script to remove handshakes from the handshake folder.  After you install this script, type "sudo chmod +x hsremove.sh" to give it execute permissions.

<b>2.</b> <i>pwnstall.sh</i> -- A script to automate the install of packages (admittedly small, but I'll continue adding to it as much as possible), and plugins.  The plugins will install from the repo, and you'll just need to choose which folder it goes into so it's with the rest of your plugins.
